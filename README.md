Repository for the research *"Populist Attitudes and Vote"*, part of the project ["*Has Demand for Populism Met Supply? An Analysis of Brazil’s 2018 General Elections"*](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Has-Demand-for-Populism-Met-Supply-An-Analysis-of-Brazils-2018-General-Elections).

We are currently developing a measure for populist attitudes using data available for Brazil. <br />
Following Castanho Silva et al. (2018 and 2019), Schulz et al. (2018) and Wuttke et al. (2020), we propose a noncompensatory multiplicative approach that takes into account the three dimensions required according to the ideational approach. <br />
We are using new data from ESEB (Brazilian Electoral Study, which is part of the CSES - Comparative Study of Electoral Systems) that allow us to measure each dimension separately. Based on recent literature, we believe (and have shown to some extent) that populist attitudes are not independent of issue and ideological positions, but the opposite: they work together shaping electoral choice.

### Data :bar_chart: :
